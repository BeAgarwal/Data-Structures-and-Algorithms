# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Implementation of all Data Structures and Algorithms and questions related to the data structures on Searching, Sorting, Stack, Queue, Linked List, Tree, Binary Search Tree, Heap, Graph, Backtracking, Trie, Dynamic Programming, etc.

### Singly (Linear) Linked List 

- [**Inserting** element at beginning of the list, end of the list, at particular position of the list, after any particular element of the list and inserting element in a sorted list.](https://github.com/BeAgarwal/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Singly%20Linked%20List/insert.cpp)
  
 - [**Deleting** first element from the list, last element from the list, particular element from the list, and deleting element from particular position of the list.](https://github.com/BeAgarwal/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Singly%20Linked%20List/delete.cpp)

- [**Search** a particular element in a list. If it is exist, then print the position of an element, otherwise print -1.](https://github.com/BeAgarwal/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Singly%20Linked%20List/search.cpp)

- [Find the **middle element** in the linked list.](https://github.com/BeAgarwal/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Singly%20Linked%20List/middleElement.cpp)

-[Find the **Nth node from end** in the linked list.](https://github.com/BeAgarwal/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Singly%20Linked%20List/NthNodeFromEnd.cpp)

### Doubly (Two way) Linked List 

- [**Inserting** element at beginning of the list, at the end of the list, and at any particular position in the list.](https://github.com/BeAgarwal/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Doubly%20Linked%20List/insert.cpp)

- [**Deleting** first element from the list, last element from the list, and any particular element from the list and deleting element at any particular position of the list.](https://github.com/BeAgarwal/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Doubly%20Linked%20List/delete.cpp)

- [**Search** a particular element in a doubly list. If it is exit, then return its position else return -1.](https://github.com/BeAgarwal/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Doubly%20Linked%20List/search.cpp)

### Circular Linked List 

- [**Inserting** element at the beginning, at the end, after any particular element, before any particular element in the list.](https://github.com/BeAgarwal/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Circular%20Linked%20List/insert.cpp)

- [**Deleting** first element from the list, last element from the list, and any particular element from the list.](https://github.com/BeAgarwal/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Circular%20Linked%20List/delete.cpp)

- [**Search** a particular element in a list. If it is exist, then print the position else print -1.](https://github.com/BeAgarwal/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Circular%20Linked%20List/search.cpp)
