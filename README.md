# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Implementation of all Data Structures and Algorithms and questions related to the data structures on Searching, Sorting, Stack, Queue, Linked List, Tree, Binary Search Tree, Heap, Graph, Backtracking, Trie, Dynamic Programming, etc.

### Singly (Linear) Linked List 

- [**Inserting** element at beginning of the list, end of the list, at particular position of the list, after any particular element of the list and inserting element in a sorted list.](https://github.com/BeAgarwal/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Singly%20Linked%20List/insert.cpp)
  
 - [**Deleting** first element from the list, last element from the list, particular element from the list, and deleting element from particular position of the list.](https://github.com/BeAgarwal/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Singly%20Linked%20List/delete.cpp)

- [**Search** a particular element in a list. If it is exist, then print the position of an element, otherwise print -1.](https://github.com/BeAgarwal/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Singly%20Linked%20List/search.cpp)
